**MD5-hash_function**

Because of Advent of Code, where I need to use the MD5 hash function, I decided to create my own implementation of MD5 in C as a side project.
I know that MD5 is not secure. It's just good as a learning side project.

There will be many small projects around, so I will atleast learn here, how to create side branches on GitHub as well.

The MD5 hash function is not finished yet.
